    <h1 style = "color: white"> The Doppler Effect </h1>
    <h5 style = "color: white"> Team members: Boyoung, Jiamae, Snehal, Nicco, Abigail </h5>
    <p style = "color: white">The Doppler effect was named after physicist Christian Doppler in 1842 and represents the change in frequency of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. </p>
    <p style = "color: white">A real life example of the Doppler effect is the change of pitch you hear when a car horn approaches and recedes from an observer. This could be like a siren. The frequency we hear is higher when it's approaching us and lower as it leaves.</p>

    <p style = "color: white"> The reason for this is that when the source of the waves moves towards the observer, the wave crest emitted is closer than the previous wave so it takes slightly less time to reach the observer than the previous one. </p>

    <p style = "color: white">The Doppler effect not only applies to the sounds we hear but also the colors we see. Its application on electromagnetic waves is used in astronomy to measure the speed at which stars and galaxies are approaching or receding from us. This results in what is called a blueshift or a redshift. This happens on a very small scale, meaning there would not be a noticeable difference in visible light to the unaided eye.</p>
    <p style = "color: white"> But what would this look like if we could see it? </p>

        <p style = "color: white"><br>Because the observer perceives a different frequency of electromagnetic radiation, the color they see changes too.
            <br>So, even though the light itself doesn't change, a moving observer perceives it differently.
            <br>As you move towards the light source, it is called a "blue shift" and it is called a "red shift" when you move away from the source.</p>
